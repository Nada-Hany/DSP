## Features

- **Signal Visualization**:

    * Plotting signals in both discrete and continuous forms.
* **Signal Operations**:

    * Perform basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, normalization, squaring, and accumulation on signals.

- **Signal Quantization**:

    - Quantize signals by bits or levels for digital representation.
- **Fourier Transform**:

    - Calculate the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) of a signal.

- **Signal Transformations**:

    - Perform shifting and folding (time reversal) operations on signals.
- **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT**):

    - Compute the DCT of a signal for frequency domain analysis.
- **Signal Convolution**:

    - Calculate the convolution of two signals.
- **Signal Derivatives**:

    - Compute the first and second derivatives of a signal.
- **Signal Correlation**:

    - Measure the correlation between two signals to assess their similarity.
- **Signal Smoothing**:

    - Smooth signals using the moving average technique.
- **DC Removal**:

    - Remove DC components from signals in both the time and frequency domains.
- **Resampling**:

    - Resample signals to a different sampling rate.
- **Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filters**:

    - Calculate FIR filter coefficients and apply the filter to a signal.
